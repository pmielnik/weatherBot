### a Weather Notification Script for Facebook Messenger
If you're someone who always forgets to check the weather and is often stuck in the rain without an umbrella, or freezing cold because they opted for a ligther jacket because it "looked warm outside", Weather Report is here to help you be better prepared for the day's weather. 

This is a simple script that I've set up to run as a lambda function on AWS that will send out a message to all friends of the [Weather Report user](https://www.facebook.com/weather.bot.96) every morning at 7am EST, containing a summary of the day's weather forecast for Waterloo, Ontario.

Here's an example of a message you could wake up to tomorrow morning!
